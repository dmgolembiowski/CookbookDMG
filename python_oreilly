# Matching Text at the Start or End of a String
"""
# Spz you need to check the start or end of a string for specific text patterns such as filename extensions, URL schemes, etc.
# The simple soln. is to use str.startswith() or str.endswith() methods.
""" Let's see it in action:
>>> filename = 'spam.txt'
>>> filename.endswith('.txt')
True
>>> filename.startswith('file:')
False
>>> url = 'http://www.pythonj.org'
>>> url.startswith('http:')
True

# If you needed to check for multiple choices, then give a tuple of of possibilities to startwith() or endswith()
>>> import os
>>> filenames = os.listdir('.')
>>> filenames
['Makefile', 'foo.c', 'bar.py', 'spam.c', 'spam.h']
